  "readme": "# Node Mail #\n\nThis SMTP client helps you send email safely and easily using\nNode.JS. It supports TLS and auth-login so you can send through\ngmail. It also implements sanity checks to safeguard against header\ninjection attacks.\n\n## Installation ##\n\nUse NPM to install:\n\n    npm install mail\n\n## Sending Mail ##\n\nThe `Mail` class encapsulates connection settings and can be used as a\nsafe, high-level mailer.\n\n    var mail = require('mail').Mail({\n      host: 'smtp.gmail.com',\n      username: 'me@gmail.com',\n      password: '**password**'\n    });\n\nUse the mailer to send messages:\n\n    mail.message({\n      from: 'sender@example.net',\n      to: ['recipient@somewhere.org'],\n      subject: 'Hello from Node.JS'\n    })\n    .body('Node speaks SMTP!')\n    .send(function(err) {\n      if (err) throw err;\n      console.log('Sent!');\n    });\n\n## Mail(options) ##\n\nCreate a new mailer that can be used to send messages.  Common options\ninclude:\n\n  + `host`: server hostname\n  + `username`: user for server authentication\n  + `password`: password for server authentication,\n\nOther options:\n\n  + `secure`: `true`, `false`, or crypto credentials (default: `true`)\n  + `port`: server listens on this port (default: 587 or 25)\n  + `domain`: the domain of the sender (default: `os.hostname()`)\n  + `mimeTransport`: `7BIT` or `8BITMIME` (default: `8BITMIME`)\n\n### Mail.message(headers) ###\n\nBegin a `MailTransaction`.  The `headers` object may contain any any\nSMTP headers.  When the message is formatted, email addresses are\nvalidated, header names are title-cased, and header values escaped to\nprevent injection.  A `Date` header is automatically added.\n\nAn email address may be an array, a single address, or a string with\ncommand-separated addresses.  Individual addresses may be bare or in\nthe format `\"Display Name\" <name@example.net>`.\n\n### MailTransaction.body(text) ###\n\nAdd a body to a mail transaction.  Long lines are automatically\nwrapped.\n\n### MailTransaction.send(callback) ###\n\nConnect to the server, transmit the message, and quit.  The callback\nshould be in the form `function(err, message) { ... }`.  Upon success,\n`err` is `null` and `message` is set to the `Message` object that was\nsent to the server.\n\n## Compatibility ##\n\nNode Mail has been tested against [qmail][1] and [gmail][2] using Node\nversion `v0.4.3`.  A working subset of these RFCs are supported:\n\n  + [Internet Message Format](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322)\n  + [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321)\n  + [Authentication Extension](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2554)\n  + [SMTP Transport Layer Security](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3207)\n  + [8-bit MIME Transport](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6152)\n\nThere is not currently direct support for multipart messages or\nattachments, although `node-mail` will send messages in this format if\nthey're build manually.\n\n[1]: http://qmail.org/top.html\n[2]: http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=13287\n\n## License ##\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 - 2011, Ben Weaver &lt;ben@orangesoda.net&gt;\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\nmet:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n  notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n  notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n  documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name of the <organization> nor the names of its\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n  this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\n\"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
